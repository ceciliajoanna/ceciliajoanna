## Fun Facts about Me ⚡
- I joined the Computer Engineering program at UFS on the first year it was launched (2009). I graduated one semester earlier, effectively making me the **1st alumni in Computer Engineering** at the university (and the state of Sergipe)
- I skipped one grade when I was 6 years old (that's why I was usually the youngest student in school/college).
- I wrote my first program when I was 13 years old (a Quadratic Equation Calculator written in ILA - a language that had a pseudocode syntax that resembled with Portuguese)
- I play guitar 🎸 (started to learn when I was around 12 years old)
- I was part of a [band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHqs8XlOXfo) while in middle/high school
